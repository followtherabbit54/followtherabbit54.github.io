    <!-- <p>to be reborn First yOu need to die</p>
    <p>leaving eveRything behind you, all the disappointments, all the sufferinG, all the mIstakes</p>
    <p>on that day, wearning my cassock, praying on my knees, I was ready for my calVary</p>
    <p>knowing dEep dowN that all this could mEan both my new life or a new death</p>
    <p>what a fool, running towardS her own destruction by her own will</p>
    <p>pasSively accepting and embracing my destiny, hoping for the best and waiting for the worst</p>
    <p>may god have mercy on us</p>
    <p>because is too late to worry too early to cry</p>
