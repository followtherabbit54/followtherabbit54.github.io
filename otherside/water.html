    <p class="white centered_text margin_top">Iron rusts from disuse; stagnant water loses its purity and in cold
        weather becomes frozen; even so does inaction sap the vigor of the mind

    <p>Become the person you were meant to be, light your inner fire and follow your heart's desire.</p>
    <p>Set your life on fire.</p>
